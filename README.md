# Overview

This is a phone book sql data base that I made to gain a better understanding of how to code with sql in python
The tools i used to make this program was sqlite3 and vs code. This program is made so that you can hold phone and address records of people you know. This program allows you to change phone numbers, names and addresses as needed and also remove those you dont want to be in contact with anymore.
